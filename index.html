      <strong>The Billboard Hot 100 chart.</strong> In the United States, it’s a mark of musical excellence. Or, at the very least, exposure and popularity.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Billboard magazine, the self-proclaimed “<a href="http://www.billboard.com/footer/biz">most influential music media brand</a>” in the world, has been charting record sales since 1940. Back then, they were <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/513492/happy-74th-birthday-billboard-charts#/column-chartbeat/happy-70th-birthday-billboard-charts-1004106212.story">polling record shops</a> across the U.S. to populate their National List of Best Selling Retail Records. They were also producing other lists based on disparate music sources, like radio airplay, sheet music sales and jukebox selections.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      In August 1958, Billboard <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer">debuted the Hot 100 chart</a>, a combination of these lists that would serve as <strong>one big representation of the nation’s musical tastes</strong>. Though it’s based primarily on sales and airplay, the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/ask-billboard/5740625/ask-billboard-how-does-the-hot-100-work">formula</a> has changed over the years with the arrival of newer technologies like digital music stores and streaming platforms.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Since it’s been around for nearly 57 years, I was curious to see how the representation of various genres on the chart has changed. More specifically, I was interested in the #1 singles. That #1 spot is a coveted position. And the longer a song stays there, <a href="http://soundcheck.wnyc.org/story/why-we-love-listen-over-and-over/">the more ingrained it becomes in our brains</a>. (Think Pharrell William’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM">Happy</a>” or Bruno Mars’ “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPf0YbXqDm0">Uptown Funk</a>,” which topped the chart for 10 and 14 weeks, respectively.)
    </p>


    <p style="margin-top:40px">
      <strong>Genres are a particularly nuanced and opinion-heavy thing in music.</strong> Chances are no one is going to argue with me over the length of a song or the year it was released. But if I assign a song the wrong genre, there could be hell to pay. I needed a way to keep this fair and uniform.
    </p> 

    <p class="">
        So I headed to iTunes, one of the biggest online music stores. (<a href="https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/02/06iTunes-Store-Sets-New-Record-with-25-Billion-Songs-Sold.html">As of Feb. 2013</a>, it had 26 million songs; I figured I’d be able to find most of the 1,012 songs <i>somewhere</i> in that.) 
    </p>


    <p style="margin-top:40px">When it was <a href="http://jasmineclee.github.io/the-year-of-no-pop/#chart-all">all said and done</a>, the expected trends were visible: 
      <ul>
        <li>Pop is all over the chart,</li>
        <li>Rock starts to fade away in the late ‘90s, and</li> 
        <li>Hip-hop shows up in 1990 (that first #1 was actually Vanilla Ice’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog8ou-ZepE">Ice Ice Baby</a>”).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      But what’s most interesting is what happened in 2004: <strong>the #1’s were only Hip-Hop and R&B songs</strong>.
    </p>

  <div class="main-text">

    <p class="">
      Pop took a bit of a dive in 2002—Kelly Clarkson’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7b8ADhadJU">A Moment Like This</a>” spent just 2 weeks at #1—but the genre came back fairly strong in 2003. In 2004, Hip-Hop and R&B took over. Now, this of course doesn’t mean that there was no Pop music in 2004. (C’mon, that was the year Britney Spears’ “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU">Toxic</a>” came out.) But it is something I didn’t expect to find.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px">
      <strong>According to pop chart analyst Chris Molanphy, the Billboard Hot 100 chart is meant to be “<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=207879695">one cogent resource for measuring where the culture is moving at any time</a></strong>.” It matters to people—both inside and outside of the music industry—and it’s becoming more accurate as the years go by. 1991 was the “<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer">B.C./A.D. moment</a>” for Billboard’s charts, as they began to use tracking data from SoundScan to determine radio airplay. WBRU-FM Program Director Wendell Clough describes the old, easily falsified way of doing things: “‘Yeah, we played that 40 times. Write it down somewhere and send it off.’ It's weird to think about it, but one realizes that some ‘number one’ hits of the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s... were not.”  
    </p>

    <p>
      More updates have been made to the chart in the last 10 years. Digital sales were incorporated in 2005, just two years after the iTunes Music Store was launched. In 2012 and 2013, streaming data were added from places like Spotify and YouTube.
    </p>

    <p>
      But assigning a genre to a piece of music is less clearly defined, especially when “Pop" comes into play. Pop is often now used to describe a certain sound; Molanphy describes it as that “sugary” and “catchy music... tailor-made for the radio and mass consumption.” But the genre itself comes from the word “popular,” and what’s popular changes with time. “Sinatra was pop,” Clough explains. “<strong>Beatles were pop. Disco was pop. Grunge was pop. Hip-hop was pop.</strong>”
    </p>

    <p>
      That explains why both Michael Jackson’s 1980 hit “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X-Mrc2l1d0">Rock With You</a>” and Ray Charles’ 1961 song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rEsVp5tiDQ">Hit the Road Jack</a>” were both labeled as Pop by iTunes. Perhaps they were Pop then, but at another point in time, they may fall somewhere in the realm of R&B/Soul. So perhaps there were actually more years on the chart like 2004—years where Pop, as we know it today, was not on top.
    </p>



<!--     <p class="">The genre "Pop" comes from the word "popular," and the Hot 100 chart was made to show popularity. Pop is often now used to describe a certain sound; <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer">according to pop music columnist Chris Molanphy</a>, it's that "sugary" and "catchy music... tailor-made for the radio and mass consumption."  And just like other genres, the general consensus on what Pop music is has varied over time. Michael Jackson's "Rock With You" was considered pop in 1980. And Ray Charles' "Hit the Road Jack" was pop in 1961. (Well, at least according to iTunes). So, <strong>all the more reason to be amazed by 2004</strong>.  -->
