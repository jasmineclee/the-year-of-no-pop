      <strong>The Billboard Hot 100 chart.</strong> In the United States, it’s a mark of musical excellence. Or, at the very least, exposure and popularity.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Billboard magazine, the self-proclaimed “<a href="http://www.billboard.com/footer/biz">most influential music media brand</a>” in the world, has been charting record sales since 1940. Back then, they were <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/513492/happy-74th-birthday-billboard-charts#/column-chartbeat/happy-70th-birthday-billboard-charts-1004106212.story">polling record shops</a> across the U.S. to populate their National List of Best Selling Retail Records. They were also producing other lists based on disparate music sources, like radio airplay, sheet music sales and jukebox selections. The Hot 100 chart came out of a desire to combine these lists into one big representation of the nation’s musical tastes.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      In August 1958, Billboard <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer">debuted the Hot 100 chart</a>, a list of the most popular songs in the country. Though it’s based primarily on sales and airplay, the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/ask-billboard/5740625/ask-billboard-how-does-the-hot-100-work">formula</a> has changed over the years with the arrival of newer technologies. That includes digital music stores such as iTunes and Google Play, and streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Billboard now has <a href="http://www.billboard.com/archive/charts">close to 100 active charts</a>, including international and genre-specific lists. But the Hot 100 is still the creme de la creme.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Since it’s been around for nearly 57 years, I was curious to see how the representation of genres has changed. More specifically, I was interested in #1 singles. That #1 spot is a coveted position. And the longer a song stays there, <a href="http://soundcheck.wnyc.org/story/why-we-love-listen-over-and-over/">the more ingrained it becomes in our brains</a>. (Think Pharrell William’s “Happy” or Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk,” which topped the chart for 10 and 14 weeks, respectively.)
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="main-text">
      Thanks to Billboard's online archive, I had easy access to the #1 singles dating back to 1959. But how could I get the genres?
    </p>
  </div>



  <div class="transition">

    <p style="margin-top:40px">
      <strong>Genres are a particularly nuanced and opinion-heavy thing in music.</strong> Chances are no one is going to argue with me over the length of a song or the year it was released. But if I pick the wrong genre, there could be hell to pay. I needed a way to keep this fair and uniform.
    </p> 

  </div>

  <div class="main-text">

    <p class="">
        So I headed to iTunes, mostly because it's one of the biggest online music stores. (<a href="https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/02/06iTunes-Store-Sets-New-Record-with-25-Billion-Songs-Sold.html">As of Feb. 2013</a>, it had 26 million songs; I figured I'd be able to find most of the 1,012 songs <i>somewhere</i> in that.) 
    </p>
    <p class="">
        I used the iTunes API to search for every song and allowed a maximum of 15 results. I didn't count any live versions or remixes, unless that was specified by Billboard. Based on the one that came up the most, I assigned a genre to each song.
    </p>
    <p class="">
        Most songs took to that treatment very well. But there were some complications with others. In some instances, genres were tied. In others, I had songs with overly specific genres (e.g., Hardcore Rap, Pop in Spanish, Soundtrack). I appreciate the attention to detail, but that wasn't useful for my search. I moved most of those specific genres into more general categories--Hardcore Rap went into Hip-Hop/Rap, Pop in Spanish went into Pop, Soundtrack went into the next most popular genre. For the ties, I looked at the earliest release date that iTunes returned.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      Then, within each year, I weighted each genre by the number of weeks it had appeared as a #1 single. For example, in 1980, Country music spent 6 weeks at the top of the chart. Due to low numbers, I grouped Disco, Easy Listening, Electronic, Jazz and Reggae into an "Other" category.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px">When it was all said and done, <strong>here's what I came out with</strong>:</p>
  </div>



  <div class="main-text">
   
    <p>The expected trends are visible:
      <ul>
        <li>Pop is everywhere (just like in real life!),</li>
        <li>Rock starts to fade away in the late '90s and</li> 
        <li>Hip-hop shows up in 1990 (that first #1 was actually Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby").</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      But what's most interesting is what happened in 2004: <strong>the #1's were only Hip-Hop and R&B songs</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom:70px">
    </p>

  <p class="chart-title">Hip-Hop/Rap vs. R&B/Soul vs. Pop, 2000-2005</p>

  </div>

  <div class="main-text">

    <p class="">
      Pop took a bit of a dive in 2002--Kelly Clarkson's "A Moment Like This" spent just 2 weeks at #1--but the genre came back fairly strong in 2003. In 2004, Hip-Hop and R&B took over. 
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Now, this of course doesn't mean that there was no Pop music in 2004. I mean, that was the year Britney Spears' "Toxic" came out! But it is something I didn't expect to find.
    </p>

    <p class="">The genre "Pop" comes from the word "popular," and the Hot 100 chart was made to show popularity. Pop is often now used to describe a certain sound; <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer">according to pop music columnist Chris Molanphy</a>, it's that "sugary" and "catchy music... tailor-made for the radio and mass consumption."  And just like other genres, the general consensus on what Pop music is has varied over time. Michael Jackson's "Rock With You" was considered pop in 1980. And Ray Charles' "Hit the Road Jack" was pop in 1961. (Well, at least according to iTunes). So, <strong>all the more reason to be amazed by 2004</strong>.
